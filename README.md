# CS688-Term-Project
For my term project, I look to utilize an NLP model to conduct *sentiment analysis*.

Specifically, I developed and trained a BERT model to achieve my task.

# Dataset

The dataset I used is from a Kaggle channel. It is an IMDB Dataset containing 50k Movie Reviews!

# Runing Streamlit UI 

Run the below code in the terminal directory to deploy Streamlit with the pre-trained model:
  - python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
